## 1. What this topic covers (short map)

This unit explains how marketing and business-development activities combine to turn an idea into a viable market venture. It includes:

- **Why marketing matters for new ventures**,
- **Situation analysis** (how to audit the internal and external environment), and
- **Core marketing concepts** you apply while designing the venture’s offering, channels and go-to-market plan.

Everything below is written as study-level, practical material you can use to analyse a venture or build a marketing plan for one (including agribusiness examples where shown).

## 2. Why marketing is central to new-venture development

Marketing for a new venture is not only advertising — it’s the discipline that ensures the product/service actually fits a real customer problem and finds a profitable way to reach those customers. For a new venture marketing:

- **Defines the market** (who will buy and why).
- **Shapes the offer** (product features, service, packaging, pricing).
- **Designs the route to customer** (channels, partners, distribution).
- **Measures early traction** and adapts the plan fast.

Marketing reduces uncertainty by turning assumptions into tested facts (through research, experiments, pilots).

## 3. Situation analysis for a new venture (how to audit before you launch)

A situation analysis is a structured fact-finding step used to form strategy. Use it to decide whether to proceed and how to position the venture.

### 3.1 Core components (and what each answers)

- **Market & Customer Analysis** — who are customers, their problems, willingness to pay, segment sizes.
- **Competitor Analysis** — who else meets that need, their strengths/weaknesses, price/service models.
- **Internal Capability Audit** — founder/team skills, technology, production capacity, finances.
- **External Environment** — political, economic, social, technological, environmental, legal (PESTEL).
- **Channel & Partner Analysis** — distribution partners, logistics, retailers, digital platforms.
- **Financial Snapshot** — required investment, projected margins, breakeven assumptions.

### 3.2 Practical frameworks to apply

- **SWOT** (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) — concise integration of internal/external.
- **PESTEL** — to spot macro trends (policy changes, climate risk for agribusiness).
- **Porter’s Five Forces** — to measure industry attractiveness (supplier power, buyer power, rivals, substitutes, entry barriers).
- **Customer Journey / Touchpoints Map** — identify moments where customers decide or drop off.

### 3.3 Quick checklist (do these research tasks)

- Run 20–50 customer interviews (problem + willingness to pay).
- Spot-check competitor pricing and channel presence.
- Calculate top-line TAM / SAM / SOM (Total / Served / Obtainable Market) estimates.
- Validate two critical assumptions with experiments (pricing and distribution).
- Create a one-page SWOT + one-page financial sensitivity (best/worst case).

### 3.4 Example (agribusiness)

If launching a small-scale cold-storage service for farmers:

- Market: perishable crops in region X; seasonality peaks.
- Competitors: local cold stores vs. on-farm storage solutions.
- PESTEL: energy costs + subsidies for cold chain, import/export rules.
- Channel: contract with farmer cooperatives; pay-per-use model.
- Critical test: pilot 1 small community for 3 months, measure spoilage reduction and farmer willingness to pay.

## 4. Core marketing concepts for new ventures

These are the building blocks you will use to design the venture’s commercial approach.

### 4.1 STP — Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning

- **Segmentation**: divide the market into meaningful groups (by need, behaviour, size).
  - Example segments for an agri-app: smallholder subsistence farmers, commercial growers, input retailers.
- **Targeting**: select which segment(s) you will serve first (start narrow).
- **Positioning**: craft a clear statement: *For [target], our [product] is the [category] that [benefit/unique reason].*

**Positioning template:**\
*For [target customer] who [need], [brand/product] is a [category] that [key benefit] because [reason to believe].*

### 4.2 Marketing Mix — 7Ps (expanded for services/new ventures)

- **Product / Service**: core solution + variants + service/support (packaging, quality levels).
- **Price**: strategy (penetration, skimming, value-based, subscription).
- **Place** (Distribution): direct sales, dealers, marketplaces, B2B partnerships.
- **Promotion**: messaging, channels (digital ads, content, field events), PR.
- **People**: staff/partners who deliver the experience — recruitment & training plan.
- **Process**: how service is delivered (speed, convenience, workflow).
- **Physical Evidence**: tangibles that signal quality (packaging, certificates, app UX).

### 4.3 Customer Value & Pricing

- Move from **cost+** pricing toward **value-based** pricing: price reflects the value created (e.g., reduced post-harvest loss = higher effective farmer income).
- **Pricing tactics** for new ventures: free trial, freemium, introductory discounts, bundled services.

### 4.4 Channels & Go-to-Market (GTM) strategies

- **Direct**: own website/app, direct sales team. Good for high-touch B2B.
- **Indirect**: distributors, dealers, cooperatives — useful in rural/agri contexts.
- **Platform**: use third-party marketplaces to reach many customers quickly.
- **Hybrid**: combine channels and measure cost per acquisition by channel.

GTM options (choose one for MVP): pilot → focused roll-out (one region/segment) → scale.

### 4.5 Promotion & Demand Generation

- **Top-of-funnel**: awareness (content marketing, social media, radio for rural areas).
- **Mid-funnel**: consideration (case studies, farmer testimonials, demo days).
- **Conversion**: trials, promotional pricing, easy signup or purchase.
- **Retention**: onboarding, follow-up support, loyalty programs.

Common funnels: **AIDA** (Awareness → Interest → Desire → Action) or **RACE** (Reach → Act → Convert → Engage).

### 4.6 Brand & Trust (critical for services)

- New ventures must build trust quickly: use guarantees, proof points (pilot results), endorsements, certifications.
- For agribusiness: link with cooperatives or extension services; show measurable outcomes (kg yield increase, % loss reduction).

### 4.7 Metrics & KPIs (what to track)

- **Acquisition**: CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), channel CPA.
- **Activation**: % trial users who become paying customers.
- **Engagement/Retention**: churn rate, repeat purchase rate.
- **Value**: LTV (Customer Lifetime Value), gross margin per customer.
- **Market**: conversion rates, uplift in farmer income (for agri solutions).

## 5. Go-to-Market plan — step-by-step for a new venture (practical blueprint)

1. **Define target segment and positioning** (one sentence).
1. **Set minimum viable offer** (MVO): the smallest set of features that deliver value.
1. **Choose pilot geography/segment** — where you can access customers and control costs.
1. **Select channels** (direct sales, dealer, digital). Estimate CAC per channel.
1. **Design messaging & proof** (case study, demonstration, video).
1. **Run small pilot (4–12 weeks)**, collect quantitative outcomes.
1. **Measure KPIs and financials**; update unit economics.
1. **Decide**: iterate, pivot, or scale. If scaling, prepare operations & partnerships.

## 6. Budgeting & resource allocation (practical guidance)

A simple early-stage marketing budget split (ballpark for many startups):

- Product/operations: 30–50%
- Customer acquisition (digital + field marketing): 20–35%
- Pilot/support and customer success: 10–20%
- Partnerships & channel development: 5–15%

(Adjust by industry: physical retail needs more distribution spend; digital ventures invest more in product/tech.)

---

## 7. Legal & regulatory considerations that affect marketing

- **Claims & labeling**: farm inputs, food products, and health claims must comply with authorities.
- **Data protection**: when you collect customer data (e.g., farmer records), follow privacy rules.
- **Advertising rules**: endorsements, pricing display, and promotional terms must be clear.
- **Contracting**: distribution agreements and channel contracts should address returns, exclusivity, and liability.

---

## 8. Common pitfalls & practical mitigations

- **Pitfall:** Launching broadly before validating demand. → **Mitigation:** pilot and measure conversion.
- **Pitfall:** Choosing partners without aligned incentives. → **Mitigation:** small test contracts, clear KPIs.
- **Pitfall:** Underestimating acquisition cost in rural areas. → **Mitigation:** use cooperatives and word-of-mouth pilots.
- **Pitfall:** Overcomplicated pricing early on. → **Mitigation:** simple transparent pricing + optional add-ons.

## 10. Agribusiness examples (applied)

### Example A — Farm advisory app (B2C / B2B hybrid)

- **Segment:** smallholder vegetable farmers near urban markets.
- **Value & positioning:** affordable, local-language agronomy advice that increases yield by X%.
- **Channels:** partner with input retailers + SMS + local extension agents.
- **Pilot:** run in 2 districts with 300 farmers; measure yield increase and repeat use.
- **Monetization:** subscription, commission on inputs sold, premium consulting.

### Example B — Packaged organic pulses (B2C retail)

- **Segment:** urban health-conscious consumers.
- **Positioning:** locally-sourced, traceable, chemical-free pulses.
- **Channels:** modern retail + e-commerce + farmer co-op supply.
- **Marketing mix:** branding & packaging (physical evidence), social proof (lab tests), in-store demos (promotion).

## 11. Conclusion — how marketing and new-venture development fit together

Marketing is the discipline that turns an untested concept into a commercially relevant venture. A proper situation analysis tells you *where* to play and *what* to offer; marketing concepts (STP, 7Ps, pricing, channels) give you the tools to create and deliver the value; and a disciplined pilot → measure → scale approach reduces risk and lets you iterate toward a repeatable business model.
