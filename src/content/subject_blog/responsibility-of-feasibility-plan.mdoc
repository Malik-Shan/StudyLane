## 1. Introduction

A **feasibility plan** is a structured analysis designed to evaluate whether a business idea can realistically succeed in the real world. It answers crucial questions such as:

- Is there enough **market demand**?
- Can the business be **technically and operationally executed**?
- Will the venture be **financially sustainable**?
- Does the idea meet **legal and regulatory standards**?

However, beyond the plan itself, one critical element is often overlooked: **responsibility**. Who is accountable for preparing, analyzing, reviewing, and implementing the feasibility plan? Understanding responsibility ensures that the feasibility study is accurate, credible, and actionable—making it a cornerstone of entrepreneurship.

## 2. Purpose of a Feasibility Plan

The feasibility plan serves multiple objectives:

1. **Decision-Making Tool** – Helps entrepreneurs decide whether to pursue, modify, or abandon an idea.
1. **Risk Identification** – Highlights potential challenges before major investments are made.
1. **Investor Confidence** – Provides evidence to attract funding by showing realistic projections.
1. **Strategic Foundation** – Acts as a blueprint for the business plan and future growth strategies.

Without clear responsibility, a feasibility plan may become superficial, inaccurate, or biased—leading to costly mistakes.

## 3. Who Holds Responsibility for the Feasibility Plan?

### 3.1 Entrepreneur / Founder

- **Primary responsibility** lies with the entrepreneur, since they are the originator of the idea.
- The entrepreneur must **define the vision**, scope of the study, and assumptions.
- They ensure that the feasibility aligns with their **strategic objectives and risk appetite**.
- Example: A farmer planning to launch an organic food startup must initiate the feasibility study and coordinate resources to validate the idea.

---

### 3.2 Project Team or Intrapreneurs

- The founder rarely works alone—**teams of specialists or intrapreneurs** are responsible for conducting research and compiling findings.
- Their role includes:
  - Conducting **market surveys** and demand analysis.
  - Evaluating **technical resources** like machinery, technology, and labor.
  - Preparing **financial models** for revenue, expenses, and profitability.
- Example: In a tech startup, the product development team would test prototypes to validate technical feasibility.

---

### 3.3 External Consultants and Experts

- Sometimes businesses hire **third-party consultants** for an unbiased evaluation.
- Consultants bring **specialized knowledge** (engineering, finance, law, or agriculture expertise).
- Their responsibility is to **challenge assumptions**, test risks, and provide independent recommendations.
- Example: A company wanting to set up a biofuel plant may hire environmental consultants to check regulatory feasibility.

---

### 3.4 Investors and Financial Institutions

- Investors are not responsible for preparing the plan, but they are responsible for **evaluating it critically**.
- They demand evidence-based projections and may require revisions before committing funds.
- Banks and venture capitalists often appoint their own analysts to review financial feasibility.

---

### 3.5 Government and Regulatory Authorities

- Indirect responsibility lies with regulators, as they ensure that projects comply with laws.
- Their role is not to prepare feasibility but to **approve or reject** based on safety, environment, and legal compliance.
- Example: Food startups must obtain licenses from food safety authorities, which indirectly validates feasibility.

## 7. Conclusion

> **Key Insight:** A feasibility plan is not just a document—it is a **collaborative responsibility** that determines whether an idea will remain a dream or become a viable business reality.
