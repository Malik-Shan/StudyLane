# Object Oriented Programming

Object Oriented Programming is a programming technique in which programs are written on the basis of object. An object is a collection of data (properties) and functions (actions). It may represent a person, thing or place in the real world. In OOP, data and all possible funcitons on data are grouped togehter. Object Oriented Programming are easier to learn and modify.

Object Oriented Programming is a powerful technique to develop software. It is used to analyze and design the applications in terms of objects. It deals with data and the procedures that process that data as a single object.

Some examples of object oriented programming are as follows:

- C++
- Smalltalk
- Eiffel
- CLOS
- Java

#### OOP Example with real-world object

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Human{
    private:
        string name;
        int age;
    public:
        Human(string n,int a){
            name = n;
            age = a;
        };
        void showName(){
            cout<< name <<endl;
        };
        void showAge(){
            cout << age << endl;
        };
};
int main() {
    Human a("Ali",20);
    a.showName();
    a.showAge();
    return 0;
};
// OUTPUT
// Ali
// 20
```

## Features of Object-Oriented Programming

- Classes
- Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Real-world Modeling

### Classes:

Object-Oriented Programming gives us the facility to design classes. A class is a protoype , template or design for creating new objects. Class contains all the properites and functions for the defining the structure and behaviour of an object without creating an instance.

### Objects:

Objects are the entities containing data and functions. In object-oriented programming we make objects using classes according to the structure and behaviour provided in the class.

### Inheritance:

It's a mechanism in which a class inherits the data and functions of another class. Inheritance allows us to use same code (data & functions) without the need of creating the same code. It's gives us a reusable code.

### Polymorphism:

Polymorphism comes from a greek word meaning "many shapes". It's a concept in object-oriented programming that's used when multiple classes are related using inheritance. As the name suggests the polymorphism allows us to redefine a function. It gives us the ability to perform the same function but in different ways.

### Encapsulation:

Object-Oriented Programming allows us to hide sensitive information from the user, a concept achieved through encapsulation. In encapsulation, all the data and functions are grouped together in a single class, allowing us to restrict access to certain components or data of an object. The private or sensitive information can then be accessed using public functions.

### Real-world Modeling:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) effectively models real-world entities by representing them as objects, which combine data and behavior. Each object is created from a class, acting as a blueprint that encapsulates relevant attributes and methods. For instance, a class representing a "Car" may include properties like color and make, alongside methods such as `start()` and `stop()`. This approach enables a more intuitive understanding of complex systems, allowing developers to mirror real-life interactions and relationships within their code.
