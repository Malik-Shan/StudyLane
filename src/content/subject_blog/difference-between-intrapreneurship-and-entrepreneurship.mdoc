## Introduction

When we think about entrepreneurship, we often imagine someone starting a new business from scratch. But innovation doesn’t only happen in startups — it also happens **inside large companies**. This is where the concept of **intrapreneurship** comes in.

Both entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship involve creativity, innovation, and risk-taking. However, they differ in **ownership, resources, risk levels, and organizational setting**. Understanding these differences is crucial for students, since exams often test your ability to **compare and contrast concepts with examples**.

## 1. Defining the Terms

### Entrepreneurship

Entrepreneurship is the process of creating, managing, and growing a **new independent business**.

- Entrepreneurs identify opportunities in the market.
- They organize resources (capital, labor, technology).
- They take personal risks to establish and grow their ventures.

👉 Example: Elon Musk starting **SpaceX** as an independent company is entrepreneurship.

### Intrapreneurship

Intrapreneurship is entrepreneurship **within an existing organization**.

- Intrapreneurs act like entrepreneurs but do so using the resources of their employer.
- They innovate, create new products, or develop new processes without leaving the company.
- The risk is lower for them personally but may affect their career.

👉 Example: The development of **Post-it Notes** at 3M was an intrapreneurship project by employees inside the company.
