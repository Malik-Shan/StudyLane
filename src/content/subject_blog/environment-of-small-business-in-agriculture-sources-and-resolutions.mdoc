## 1. Introduction

Agriculture is one of the oldest and most important industries, yet it faces unique challenges in the modern era. **Small businesses in agriculture**â€”such as family farms, small agribusinesses, and rural enterprisesâ€”play a vital role in food production and rural development.

However, these small ventures are highly dependent on their **environment**â€”the external and internal factors that influence their operations. Understanding the sources of these challenges and finding practical resolutions is essential for sustaining and growing small agricultural enterprises.

## 2. The Business Environment in Agriculture

The environment refers to the **conditions, forces, and institutions** that surround and impact small businesses. It can be divided into:

- **Internal Environment**: Resources, skills, organizational structure, culture.
- **External Environment**: Market conditions, government policies, climate, technology, and society.

ðŸ‘‰ For agricultural entrepreneurship, both internal and external environments are dynamic and require constant adaptation.
