In expository writing, *defining the objective* is crucial because it establishes the primary purpose or focus of the piece. This topic addresses the “why” behind the writing—explaining *what* the author aims to convey and *why* it matters to the reader. By defining the objective, the writer provides clarity, direction, and a basis for selecting relevant information, ensuring that the content is purposeful and aligns with the reader’s needs.

### Why Is It Used?

1. **Clarity and Focus**\
   Defining the objective helps the writer remain clear and focused on the main topic. When the writer knows the objective, they’re less likely to include irrelevant details, which helps readers grasp the main message without distraction.
1. **Guiding Information Selection**\
   An objective narrows down which information to include or omit. It encourages the writer to only present facts, explanations, or instructions that directly support the purpose, making the content concise and impactful.
1. **Providing Reader Value**\
   When the writer defines an objective, they consider the reader’s perspective and needs, ensuring that the writing is relevant and valuable. It aligns the writer’s intent with the reader’s expectations, which increases engagement and comprehension.
1. **Supporting Organization**\
   With a clear objective, the structure of the writing becomes more logical and coherent. Each section serves the central goal, enhancing readability by ensuring a logical flow and progression from introduction to conclusion.
