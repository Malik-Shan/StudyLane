## 1. Introduction

Service ventures are entrepreneurial businesses that provide **intangible value** to customers instead of physical goods. Unlike product-based enterprises that focus on manufacturing and selling tangible items, service ventures revolve around **skills, expertise, experiences, and solutions**.

Examples: A digital marketing agency, a hospital, a financial consultancy, or even a rural agribusiness cooperative providing crop advisory.

Understanding the **different types of service ventures** helps entrepreneurs identify opportunities, design models, and align strategies with customer needs.

## 2. Characteristics of Service Ventures

Before we break into types, it is important to recall what makes services unique compared to products:

1. **Intangibility** â€“ cannot be touched or stored (e.g., teaching, healthcare).
1. **Inseparability** â€“ service is produced and consumed at the same time (e.g., haircut, consultation).
1. **Variability** â€“ quality may differ depending on provider or situation.
1. **Perishability** â€“ services cannot be stored for future use (e.g., an empty hotel room today is a lost opportunity).

These characteristics influence how service ventures operate, market, and scale.
