## 1. Introduction

At the heart of every entrepreneurial venture lies a **product or service**. A business cannot exist without offering something of **value** to its customers. Understanding the concept of products and services is essential because they are the **core value proposition**â€”what customers pay for, and what differentiates one business from another.

In entrepreneurship, this topic deals with:

- What constitutes a **product** and a **service**.
- The **differences and overlaps** between them.
- How entrepreneurs conceptualize, design, and deliver these offerings.
- Why **customer needs and satisfaction** are central to product/service development.

## 2. Defining Product and Service

### 2.1 Product

- A **product** is a **tangible offering**â€”something that can be seen, touched, stored, and transferred.
- It has a **physical form** and usually involves **manufacturing or production processes**.
- Examples:
  - Smartphones, clothes, furniture, packaged food.
  - In agriculture: wheat, rice, fruits, or dairy products.

### 2.2 Service

- A **service** is an **intangible offering**â€”it cannot be physically touched, owned, or stored.
- It is an **experience or activity** delivered to the customer.
- Examples:
  - Healthcare, education, consulting, banking.
  - In agriculture: soil testing services, farm equipment leasing, or agri-consulting.

## 4. Overlap of Product and Service (Hybrid Offerings)

In modern business, many offerings are **a mix of product and service**.

- Example 1: Buying a **car** (product) comes with **maintenance service**.
- Example 2: A **smartphone** (product) includes **warranty and customer support service**.
- Example 3: In agriculture, selling **fertilizers** (product) often includes **farmer training services** on how to use them.

This overlap shows that entrepreneurs should not limit themselves to one category but think in terms of **value packages**.

## 5. Product and Service Life Cycle

Every offering goes through **stages of life**:

1. **Introduction** â€“ Launch of new product/service, heavy promotion required.
1. **Growth** â€“ Increasing customer acceptance, higher sales.
1. **Maturity** â€“ Market saturation, competition rises, focus shifts to differentiation.
1. **Decline** â€“ Sales fall due to new innovations, changing trends, or obsolescence.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

- **Product**: DVD players â†’ introduction in 1990s, growth in 2000s, maturity by 2010, decline due to streaming services.
- **Service**: Internet cafes â†’ grew rapidly in early 2000s, declined with personal mobile internet access.
