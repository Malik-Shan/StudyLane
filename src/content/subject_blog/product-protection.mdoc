## 1. Introduction

When entrepreneurs develop new products, their success depends not only on innovation and marketing but also on how well they **protect their creations**. Product protection refers to the **legal, strategic, and practical measures** taken to secure ownership rights, prevent unauthorized use, and ensure the business retains competitive advantage.

Without protection, competitors may copy or misuse products, leading to **loss of revenue, reduced brand value, and weakened market position**. Hence, product protection is central to both entrepreneurship and long-term sustainability.
