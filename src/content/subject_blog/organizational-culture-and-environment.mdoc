🌟 2. Organizational Culture and Environment – Explained in Simple English

🔹 Meaning of Organizational Culture

Organizational culture means the way people behave and work together in a company. It includes the values, beliefs, traditions, and rules that guide how employees think, act, and communicate.

In simple words, it's like the personality of the organization — what is accepted, what is not, and how things are done.

🔹 Elements of Culture

There are three main parts (elements) of organizational culture:

1. ✅ Values – Core ideas the company believes in (e.g., honesty, teamwork).
1. ✅ Beliefs – What people in the company think is true or important.
1. ✅ Norms – The normal behavior or unwritten rules (e.g., how to dress or talk at work).

Together, these create the company’s unique culture.

🔹 Internal vs External Environment

🏠 Internal Environment: Includes factors inside the company like employees, managers, company structure, and culture.

🌍 External Environment: Includes factors outside the company like customers, competitors, government rules, economy, and technology.

Both affect how the company runs and makes decisions.

🔹 Importance of Environment in Decision-Making

Managers must understand the environment before making decisions. For example:

If the economy is down, they may reduce costs.

If customer needs change, they may update products.

So, the environment helps managers make better, smarter, and timely decisions.

🔹 Adapting to Environmental Changes

The business world is always changing, so companies must adapt to survive.

New technologies, market trends, or government laws may affect business.

Managers must adjust strategies, train staff, and update plans when needed.

Companies that adapt quickly to change are more likely to grow and succeed.

✅ Conclusion

In short, organizational culture shows how people work together, and the environment includes all internal and external factors that affect the company. Managers must understand both to make the right decisions and help the business grow in a changing world.
