## 1. Introduction

Before launching a business idea, entrepreneurs must evaluate whether it is **feasible**—that is, if the idea can realistically succeed given available resources, market demand, and external conditions. Alongside feasibility, **planning** provides a structured roadmap for execution. Together, they form the foundation of a sustainable entrepreneurial venture.

## 2. Feasibility in Entrepreneurship

Feasibility refers to the **practicality and viability** of turning an idea into a functioning business. It answers the question: *“Can this idea work in the real world?”*

### 2.1 Dimensions of Feasibility

1. **Market Feasibility**
   - Is there real customer demand?
   - Who is the target audience?
   - What is the size and growth potential of the market?
1. **Technical Feasibility**
   - Do we have the technology, equipment, and skills required?
   - Can the product or service be produced at scale?
1. **Financial Feasibility**
   - How much capital is needed?
   - Are there sufficient profit margins?
   - Can the venture generate positive cash flow?
1. **Organizational/Operational Feasibility**
   - Is the team capable of executing the plan?
   - Are resources and supply chains available?
1. **Legal/Regulatory Feasibility**
   - Does the business comply with laws and regulations?
   - Are there barriers such as patents or licensing requirements?

## 3. Concepts of Planning in Entrepreneurship

Planning is the process of **setting goals, outlining strategies, and designing actions** to achieve success. It transforms an idea into an actionable path.

- **Goal-Oriented** – Focused on achieving specific outcomes.
- **Strategic and Flexible** – Adapts to changing environments.
- **Comprehensive** – Covers marketing, finance, operations, HR, and legal aspects.

### 3.2 Levels of Planning

1. **Strategic Planning** – Long-term direction and vision (5–10 years).
1. **Tactical Planning** – Medium-term strategies (1–3 years).
1. **Operational Planning** – Day-to-day activities and short-term execution.

## 5. Importance of Feasibility and Planning

- Attracts investors by demonstrating preparedness.
- Prevents resource wastage on unviable ideas.
- Provides a **roadmap** for launching and scaling a business.
- Ensures alignment between vision, resources, and opportunities.

## 6. Real-World Examples

- **Uber** – Conducted feasibility by testing ride-sharing in limited markets before scaling globally.
- **Airbnb** – Started with a small-scale feasibility test (renting out air mattresses) before building a global platform.
- **Agribusiness Example** – A farmer planning to invest in organic produce evaluates demand in urban markets, checks financial feasibility of higher costs, and ensures compliance with food safety regulations.

## 7. Conclusion

Feasibility and planning are **the twin pillars of entrepreneurship**. A feasible idea ensures the business has a real chance of success, while planning provides the structure to make it happen. Without feasibility, even the best plan will fail; without planning, even the most feasible idea may collapse.

> **Key Insight:** A successful entrepreneur first asks, *“Can this idea work?”* and then plans carefully to make it a reality.
