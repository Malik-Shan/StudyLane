*Encapsulation is a programming technique that's used to store, hide, and manipulate data in a controlled way. It's a key feature of object-oriented programming (OOP). The private and sensitive data can be accessed using public functions.*

## Encapsulation is used for a number of reasons, including:

#### Data protection:

Encapsulation prevents accidental or intentional changes to data from outside the class. This helps ensure data integrity and protects sensitive information.

#### Code reusability:

Encapsulated classes are often more reusable because they function as self-contained units with clearly defined interfaces.

#### Improved maintainability:

Changes to the internal implementation of a class are less likely to affect other parts of the program.

#### Decoupling Encapsulation:

encourages decoupling, which means that external code doesn't need to be concerned with the internal workings of an object.

#### Consistent Interface:

Encapsulation allows developers to present a consistent interface that's independent of its internal implementation.
