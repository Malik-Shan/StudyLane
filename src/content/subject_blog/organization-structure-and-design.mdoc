🔹 Definition of Organization Structure

An organizational structure shows how tasks are divided, who reports to whom, and how work flows in a company.

In simple words, it is like a company's framework that shows the roles, responsibilities, and relationships among employees and departments.

🔹 Types of Structures

There are 3 common types of organization structures:

1. 🟦 Functional Structure

People are grouped based on their job functions (e.g., marketing, finance, HR).

Each department does one main type of work.

Example: All marketing people are in one team.

2. 🟥 Divisional Structure

The company is divided based on products, locations, or customers.

Each division has its own departments (HR, sales, etc.).

Example: One division for electronics, one for clothing.

3. 🟨 Matrix Structure

A combination of functional and divisional structures.

Employees may report to two bosses: one functional and one project manager.

It improves teamwork but can be confusing sometimes.

🔹 Chain of Command

The chain of command means who reports to whom in an organization.
It shows the line of authority from top managers to lower staff.
It helps maintain order and responsibility in the workplace.

Example:
CEO → Department Head → Team Leader → Employee

---

🔹 Span of Control

Span of control means the number of employees that a manager supervises directly.

👥 A wide span means one manager supervises many people.

👤 A narrow span means one manager supervises a few people.

The ideal span depends on the type of work and the manager’s ability.

🔹 Centralization vs Decentralization

🏢 Centralization

All major decisions are made at the top level.

Employees have less freedom.

Suitable for small companies or during a crisis.

🏬 Decentralization

Decision-making is shared with middle or lower levels.

Employees have more responsibility.

Suitable for large and growing companies.

---

🔹 Formal vs Informal Structure

📝 Formal Structure

Clearly defined jobs, reporting lines, and rules.

Official and written structure.

Example: Job titles, reporting hierarchy.

🗣️ Informal Structure

Social connections and personal relationships in the workplace.

Not officially planned, but still important.

Example: Friendship groups among employees.
