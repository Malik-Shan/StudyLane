## 1. Introduction

In entrepreneurship, **intellectual property (IP)** plays a central role in safeguarding innovations and building competitive advantage. Two of the most powerful IP tools are **trademarks** and **patents**. While both protect creativity and innovation, they serve different purposes:

- **Trademarks** protect the **identity** of a business (brand names, logos, symbols).
- **Patents** protect the **technical inventions and innovations** (products, processes, technologies).

Together, they allow entrepreneurs to **differentiate their businesses, secure market exclusivity, and build long-term value**.

## 2. Trademark

### 2.1 Definition

A **trademark** is a recognizable sign, design, word, phrase, or symbol that identifies and distinguishes the products or services of one business from others.

**Example:**

- The **Nike swoosh**, the word **“Google”**, or the **Coca-Cola script logo**.

### 2.2 Functions of Trademarks

1. **Identification** – helps customers recognize the source of goods.
1. **Brand Loyalty** – builds trust and emotional attachment with customers.
1. **Legal Protection** – prevents others from using confusingly similar marks.
1. **Marketing Tool** – serves as a powerful element in advertising and promotion.

### 2.3 Types of Trademarks

- **Word Marks** (Google, Adidas)
- **Logos and Symbols** (Apple logo, Mercedes-Benz star)
- **Slogans** (“Just Do It”)
- **Colors/Shapes** (Tiffany Blue, Coca-Cola bottle shape)
- **Sounds** (Intel jingle, MGM lion’s roar)

### 2.4 Duration of Trademark Protection

- Trademarks can be renewed **indefinitely** (usually every 10 years), as long as they are in active use.

## 3. Patent

### 3.1 Definition

A **patent** is a government-granted right that gives the inventor **exclusive control** over the production, use, and sale of an invention for a limited period, typically **20 years**.

**Example:**

- The patent for the **telephone** by Alexander Graham Bell.
- Modern patents for **smartphone technologies** (Apple, Samsung).

### 3.2 Functions of Patents

1. **Protects Inventions** – prevents competitors from making, using, or selling the invention.
1. **Encourages Innovation** – rewards inventors with exclusivity.
1. **Monetization** – patents can be licensed or sold for royalties.
1. **Market Exclusivity** – ensures no competitor can replicate the invention for a fixed period.

### 3.3 Types of Patents
