## 1. Introduction

At first glance, the word **“fantasy”** may sound unrelated to entrepreneurship. However, in the context of innovation, **fantasies refer to imaginative ideas, visions, or dreams that may not yet have a clear path to reality**.

Entrepreneurship thrives on imagination. Many groundbreaking innovations started as “fantasies” — ideas that seemed unrealistic, impossible, or even absurd at the time. The entrepreneurial skill lies in transforming those fantasies into practical solutions.

👉 In short: Fantasies represent the **creative spark** that fuels innovation.
