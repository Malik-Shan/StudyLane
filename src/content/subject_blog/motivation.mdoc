🔹 Theories of Motivation

There are two famous theories that explain how motivation works:

---

1. 🧱 Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs
   Maslow said people have 5 levels of needs:
1. Physiological Needs – Basic needs like food, water, rest.
1. Safety Needs – Job security, safe workplace.
1. Social Needs – Friendship, teamwork.
1. Esteem Needs – Respect, recognition.
1. Self-Actualization – Achieving full potential and growth.

🔁 Employees move from lower needs to higher ones step by step.

2. 🛠️ Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory
   Herzberg said there are two types of factors:

Hygiene Factors – Basic things like salary, job safety, company rules.
(These do not motivate, but if missing, they cause dissatisfaction.)

Motivator Factors – Things like growth, achievement, recognition.
(These truly motivate people to perform better.)

🔹 Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation

🎯 Intrinsic Motivation

Comes from inside the person (self-interest).

Example: Doing work because you love it or feel proud.

💰 Extrinsic Motivation

Comes from outside rewards like salary, promotion, or praise.

Example: Working harder for a bonus or gift.

Both types are important and can be used together.
