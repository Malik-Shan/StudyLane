# Dear Students,

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I am writing to inform you that the government has officially declared winter holidays from **December 23rd** to **December 31st**. Consequently, our institute will remain closed during this period.

Classes will resume on **January 1st , 2024**. Should you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to discuss them with me. Your understanding and cooperation are highly appreciated.

**Warm regards,**

**Kanwal Malik**

**Admin Manager**
