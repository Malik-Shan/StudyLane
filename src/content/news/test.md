Dear Students,

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I am writing to inform you that the government has officially declared winter holidays from December 23rd to December 31st. Consequently, our institute will remain closed during this period.

Classes will resume on January 1st, 2024. Should you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to discuss them with me. Your understanding and cooperation are highly appreciated.

Warm regards,
Kanwal Malik
Admin Manager
